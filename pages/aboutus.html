            PRAYAAS is governed by its motto- “AN HOUR A DAY, KEEPS ILLITERACY AWAY.” Prayaas envisions a locality where no kid lies in the darkness of illiteracy. It dreams of a country where no child lingers palely in slums and the children are free to dream. A locality in which they celebrate their innocence instead of going from one house to the other, collecting garbage.
            A group of NITJ students under the able guidance of Chemistry Professor Dr. Balbir Singh Kaith conceptualised PRAYAAS in 2008 which was aimed at ameliorating the underprivileged kids in the locality. Since then, it has not looked back. Presently, we have around 220 kids regularly being taught free of cost by around 90 NITJ students. We would urge you to support PRAYAAS by giving some of your time.
